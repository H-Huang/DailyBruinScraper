The 2016 election had a voter turnout of 40.3 percent.\nThe four referenda passed in the election will increase student fees by $33.99 per student per quarter for the 2016-2017 academic year. All referenda fees except the Green Initiative Fund will be tied to inflation.\nStudents will pay $6 per quarter for the #UCLAwellness Referendum, which will support UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services, the USAC Contingency Programming Fund and three undergraduate student government offices. The fee will increase to $12 in fall 2017 and again to $18 per quarter in fall 2018.\n\u201cStudents groups on campus finally have a stable source of funding,\u201d said Zack Dameron, a USAC Community Services commissioner who helped lead the referendum\u2019s campaign. \u201cWith over 60 percent of the vote, the students have overwhelmingly spoken in favor of this and mental health issues will finally become a priority.\u201d\nThe UCLA undergraduate student body voted to pass the Daily Bruin and Bruinwalk.com referendum by 65.3 percent, increasing student fees by $3 per quarter to support UCLA Student Media organizations. UCLA Student Media is comprised of the Daily Bruin, seven community newsmagazines, BruinLife yearbook and UCLA Radio.\nSam Hoff, editor in chief of the Daily Bruin, said he thinks the referendum\u2019s passage shows how much the student body values having an independent press on campus. Hoff, a fourth-year geography and environmental studies student, added he thinks students supported the referendum because the Daily Bruin ran a transparent campaign.\n\u201cThe Daily Bruin has been around since 1919, and it warms my heart to see that the student body wants to continue supporting it,\u201d Hoff said.\nThe Green Initiative Fund, a fee passed in 2008 that was set to expire in 2018, was renewed and will now exist indefinitely. The fund aims to support student-initiated sustainability programs on campus such as the JazzReggae Festival and Ecochella, and will continue to cost students $4.80 per quarter.\nIan Cocroft, current USAC Facilities commissioner and a representative for the Green Initiative Fund Referendum, said the campaign managers decided not to spend money on the campaign by campaigning online instead. Cocroft added he wanted to ensure no environmental waste was created through flyers or boards that would have been thrown away after the election.\n\u201cThe best outcome would have been to pass a fund tied to inflation, so that the buying power of the fund could remain the same over the years,\u201d Cocroft said. \u201cBut I decided to make a political calculation and not seek to raise student fees.\u201d\nThe Social Justice Referendum will institute a $24.99 quarterly fee to fund Community Programs Office-affiliated groups, the Academic Advancement Program and a variety of retention and outreach programs.\nJazz Kiang, designated representative of the referendum and chairperson of the Campus Retention Committee, said funds from the referendum will go towards supporting LGBT students, culture nights and organizing resources to ensure students graduate on time.\nKiang, a fourth-year Asian American studies student, added he hopes the John Wooden Center Board of Governors decides to keep the Wooden Center open 24 hours a day using the funds from the referendum.\nThe Election Board announced the results in Meyerhoff Park Friday evening.\nContributing reports by Jorge Valero, Kuhelika Gosh, Kartik Kolachina and Anjishnu Das, Bruin contributors.\n ",

        "content": "\nThe UCLA Volunteer Center cut ties with an annual volunteering event in Westwood last year to focus its resources on more meaningful projects that engage the community, center officials said.\nWestwood community leaders organized the Westwood Organized Meaningful Projects from 2010 to 2014. The Volunteer Center was an official sponsor until 2014 when officials decided they would only help recruit student volunteers.\nDuring WOMP projects, about 300 to 500 students planted trees, removed graffiti and cleaned streets throughout Westwood Village.\nVolunteer Center officials questioned whether Westwood needed the event after the creation of the Westwood Village Improvement Association, an organization operating the Westwood Business Improvement District, in 2011. The association provides Westwood Village with services such as sidewalk cleaning, tree trimming and lobbying to city officials about interests concerning Westwood.\nAndrew Thomas, executive director of the association, said association ambassadors would often have to redo WOMP projects because they were not done properly, which cost the association time and money.\nSteve Sann, chair of the Westwood Community Council and founder of WOMP, said he thinks WOMP can complement the association\u2019s efforts by providing services the association does not have the time or money to offer. He added WOMP focused on places outside of the association\u2019s boundaries, such as the Westwood Branch Library and the Westwood Recreation Center on Sepulveda Boulevard.\nThe Volunteer Center also had concerns about liability, former UCLA Volunteer Center Director Rachel Corell said. She added WOMP recruits more than 300 volunteers who may injure themselves or others during the event.\nSann said no one has been injured during WOMP projects, and organizers bought a one-day event insurance plan that covered student volunteers and passersby.  The American Red Cross at UCLA would also have a booth in Westwood during WOMP to provide aid to volunteers if needed, he added.\nCorell also said Sann never provided UCLA with records of expenditures even after the Volunteer Center requested them. Sann said WOMP organizers always met before the event, and he showed them the budget then. He added most donations, such as T-shirts and other materials such as paint, were not monetary.\nEmails between Corell and current Volunteer Center Director Shannon Hickman, sent to the Daily Bruin in compliance with the California Public Records Act, show Sann trying to continue WOMP.\n\nCorell told Hickman she had already told Sann UCLA would not participate in WOMP, but he was free to organize it on his own.\n\u201cUCLA does plenty of other meaningful, local community work,\u201d Corell said in the email. \u201cWe want no part in a disorganized event with no budget, permits or planning.\u201d\nSann said WOMP relied on the Volunteer Center for supplies and recruitment. He added he hopes WOMP or a similar event will happen in the near future. \nDespite UCLA\u2019s decisions, several people said they think it was a good way to get UCLA students involved in Westwood.\nClinton Schudy, owner of Oakley\u2019s Barber Shop who serves on the association\u2019s board of directors, said many of his student clients told him WOMP made them want to go into Westwood more often. He added he thinks it also made the Village look cleaner.\nArmen Hadjimanoukian, a UCLA alumnus who co-chaired WOMP in its final two years, said he liked that WOMP gave students who come from all over the world a sense of community through volunteering. He added he thinks it provided a space where students could interact with homeowners and business owners from the area.\n\u201cWhen you would go to the Village after with your friends, you can look at the projects you worked on, and that gave you a good feeling,\u201d Hadjimanoukian said.\nHe added he would like to see UCLA and Westwood community leaders work together to make WOMP happen again.\nHickman said the Volunteer Center still provides local volunteering opportunities in Westwood Village.\n ",

        "content": "\nAt the start of the day, Margaret LaGaly feeds her sourdough starter using flour ground from the wheat she plucked from her backyard. This is the start of the daylong cooking process.\nShe waits for the dough to rise and places it in her home oven to bake.\n\u201cI love the simplicity of the 24-hour cooking process,\u201d LaGaly said. \u201cMaking something so simple but insanely beautiful with three ingredients is really special.\u201d \nLaGaly, a second-year English student, founded Winslow Bread Company in January 2016. She would cook at home and sell her bread to UCLA floormates and her brother\u2019s friends. \nLaGaly\u2019s love of baking began at her dinner table, where she would join her family every week to enjoy her mother\u2019s baked bread. LaGaly was always in the garden, tending to her seven fruit trees and small square of wheat stalks.\n\u201cFood was always a huge part of our family,\u201d LaGaly said. \u201cI had a foundation in baking from my mother, but not nearly to the extent that I have now.\u201d\nLaGaly was later inspired to bake sourdough after a trip to Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, where she fell in love with the preparation, baking and consumption of sourdough bread. \nUsing Tartine\u2019s cookbook as inspiration, LaGaly developed sourdough recipes for classic country, sesame, olive rosemary and seeded loaves.  After launching Winslow Bread Company, she gradually built her business online with Google forms and a Facebook page where customers can place orders.\nOne of her customers and former floormate Akash Raman said after he ate one of her olive rosemary loaves, it was clear LaGaly had a knack for baking. LaGaly once used the faculty-in-residence\u2019s kitchen to bake bread, much to the delight of the entire building, said Raman, a third-year economics and Spanish student.\n\u201cMargaret really makes an effort to make every loaf fresh, you can honestly taste the passion,\u201d Raman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not often you can get bread as fresh as hers.\u201d \nBy March, LaGaly was baking 12 loaves a week in her home kitchen, selling each for $12. She said it took her a while to eventually reach a number she was comfortable with.\nLaGaly said she fell in love with baking and consuming sourdough bread after a trip to Tartine Bakery in San Francisco. She now looks to the bakery's cookbook for inspiration to develop different sourdough recipes. (Shelby Scoggins/Daily Bruin)\n\u201cI thought if I\u2019m going to to make four loaves I might as well make eight,\u201d LaGaly said. \u201cThen eight became 10 and 10 became 12. I was adding too many baking hours to handle.\u201d\nHowever, business came to an abrupt halt at the end of winter quarter. One morning she made the leaven at home and left, but when she came back from school to check on the dough, something was wrong.\n\u201cIt looked very weird,\u201d she said. \u201cThe smell and texture were very off.\u201d\nWith an order for 12 loaves due the next day, she began testing different possibilities for why the recipe was off. Was it the flour, was it the water? She couldn\u2019t complete the order, so she sent her customers blueberry muffins as an apology.\n\u201cIt was definitely a very humbling experience because until then I was in my little routine thinking, \u2018Yeah I\u2019m on such a roll right now, people are loving this,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s such a sourdough thing. Sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nLaGaly hasn\u2019t sold bread since. LaGaly is focused on restarting her business and obtaining her cottage food license, which would allow her to legally sell to her customers directly, as well as eventually sell indirectly through cafes and other restaurants. However, she isn\u2019t too eager to operate her own commercial bakery.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t run my own bakery until I\u2019m out of college,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now I like the intimacy of my business; being able to see my customers every week is something I really enjoy.\u201d\nLaGaly said preparing bread the same way it has been prepared for centuries with just yeast, flour, water and salt is a grounding experience. She said she\u2019s not interested in the money; rather, her business is more of a way to fuel her baking zeal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a high-profit-margin kind of business,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time I pull a loaf out of the oven, I\u2019m amazed; it\u2019s the most beautiful, naturally occurring bread you will ever see.\u201d\n ",

        "content": "\n The flyers, high-fives and small talk from Undergraduate Students Association Council candidates don\u2019t extend to the Hill, but USAC\u2019s importance does. \nThe 14 newly elected student officials will institute policies and services with millions of dollars\u2019 worth of student fees. Every undergraduate student pays into USAC, and they are all affected by its decisions. \nBut while there are more than 12,000 students living on the Hill, the USAC Election Code prevents people from campaigning there. \nUCLA Housing needs to promote the political conversations that should be in students\u2019 lives by loosening its restrictions on Hill campaigning. Candidates should be able to talk to residents in areas with heavy foot traffic like outside dining halls.\nThe current election code policy should not be so strict that it prevents residents from discussing, analyzing and critiquing the USAC candidates and referenda.\nThe Hill houses the vast majority of first-year students. This is the same group that needs more attention in order to raise student voter turnout and promote civic engagement because its members will be affected by the results the longest, especially the referenda on the ballot. \nAccording to the UCLA On Campus Housing handbook, the term \u201ccampaigning\u201d is defined as any display on the part of any person for the purpose of convincing other people to vote for or against a candidate, initiative, referendum, constitutional amendment or recall. \nWhile UCLA Residential Life and Housing do not allow for any campaigning on the Hill,  they do encourage their resident assistants and housing government representatives to support positive community engagement in the elections process. Karen Hedges, the associate director of leadership and engagement in Residential Life, said that more than 300 student leaders on the Hill do this through dialogue and passively educating their residents through bulletin boards about the different slates and candidates involved in the elections process. \nHowever, these materials don\u2019t promote the discussion they should. Moreover, resident assistants must maintain a level of public impartiality that draws a blurry line between relaying information and promoting a stance. This policy perpetuates an attitude that drives political apathy. \nRemoving the Hill\u2019s impartiality would encourage students to have more discussions. It would allow them to begin talking about experiences and the ongoing issues that are in effect at a large institution like UCLA every single day.\nAllowing USAC candidates and proponents of certain referenda to campaign on the Hill would encourage students to talk about these issues on a more intimate level. It would urge residents to have late-night conversations around the radical ideas and activism that college students are best known for during their academic careers.\nThe election board states currently that campaign material of any kind is prohibited within residence and dining halls, but Residential Life adds \u201ccampaigning stops at the bottom of the Hill,\u201d according to Hedges. \nBoth entities maintain the stance during the entirety of the election process because they feel students receive enough information while on campus. \n\u201cWe restrict campaigning on the Hill because we want to create a space for students to retreat to\u201d said Lindsay Allen, the USAC Election Board chair. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to pack every single space at UCLA with USAC discussions.\u201d \nThis is a fair perspective. The policy should continue to restrict USAC candidates from walking into residence halls and go door-to-door knocking to ask residents to vote for them, but keeping the discussions off the Hill entirely is problematic.\nWhile students are on campus, they are in a rush to get to class or exams during this time of the year. When back on the Hill, students have more freedom and recreational time that they can allot to having these political conversations. Keeping USAC campaigning out of these spaces increases apathy. \nPolitical discussions should happen in every space. Whether on the Hill or on campus, the issues driving the campaign \u2013 social justice, sustainability, transparency \u2013 are not abolished. These ideas permeate UCLA in the most intimate ways and students should be able to recognize it.\nThe bottom line is that students cannot simply close their doors on the importance of exercising their democratic responsibilities.\n ",

(Daily Bruin file photo)\nBornstein and Beltrez, on the other hand, have yet to register a decathlon or heptathlon score in the outdoor season, so this weekend will be the first and \u2013 depending on their performance \u2013 could also be the last competition of the year. \nThe conference championship is the last opportunity athletes have to qualify for the NCAA regional championship, where their performance could land them a seed in the national championship meet.\nThe two regional championships \u2013 one for the west, and one for the east \u2013 take 24 multi-event athletes with the best scores for their respective event spread, so Gustafson is in a good position to qualify for the western one as it is. \nThe 24th scores for the decathlon and heptathlon in the western region right now are 7,007 and 5,225, respectively. Bornstein and Beltrez will have to comfortably break those this weekend to qualify for the NCAA regional, and Bornstein\u2019s best decathlon is just 16 points shy of the 24th place score.\nMountain Pacific Sports Federation and UCLA record holder Steele Wasik will not compete this weekend, as he is still recovering from an injury he sustained at the NCAA indoor championship in mid-March. \nIn his first decathlon ever last year, Wasik secured the eighth best score in UCLA history, and has the best indoor heptathlon score of any multi-event athlete that has come through the UCLA program. \nWithout a decathlon score for the outdoor season, Wasik will have to forgo the NCAA regional and national meet. At the indoor championship earlier this year, he was the No. 9 seed.\nBack home in Los Angeles, select members of the distance team will go to the Occidental Invitational to run in their final regular season races, but everyone else will take the weekend off in preparation of their own conference championship.\nThe men\u2019s team swept USC in every distance event last weekend while the women\u2019s team only took nine out of the 27 distance points.\n\n ",

        "content": "\nEditor\u2019s note: The referenda on the USAC ballot did not directly compete with one another, but in the interest of full transparency, we believe it is worth noting one of the referenda on this year\u2019s ballot directly benefitted the Daily Bruin financially.\nThe USAC Election Board must retroactively disqualify the Social Justice Referendum for incurring yet another violation in the hours leading up to the election result.\nThe most recent violation was the latest in a week full of them, and the election board\u2019s weak enforcement of the rules has enabled the campaign to operate with near impunity.\nAnd while the votes may be in, the job of the election board does not end with the election. Until the board sends the results to USAC on Tuesday for approval, it is well within its power to declare the passage of the referendum illegitimate.\nElection board Chair Lindsay Allen told The Bruin on Thursday that additional violations by the Social Justice Referendum would result in either a ban on online campaigning or disqualification, depending on their severity. This came after the board ruled that the referendum could not campaign on campus from 3 p.m. on Thursday until voting ended at 3 p.m. on Friday.\nYet Friday afternoon, the Westwood Village Entertainment Group performed on Bruin Walk imploring students to \u201cVote yes for SJR.\u201d The band\u2019s CEO and founder Munir Griffin said a referendum representative solicited the performance. Even though the band wasn\u2019t told to endorse the referendum explicitly, many performers wore Social Justice Referendum shirts and the performance was clearly in violation of the sanction.\nAfter the results, Allen told The Bruin that the board received a violation form just before 4:30 p.m. Friday about the referendum campaigning through the Westwood Village Entertainment Group.\nHowever, after consulting with adviser Kris Kaupalolo about the violation form, Allen said the board decided to not consider the sanction because it was \u201ctoo late,\u201d even though there are no hard rules indicating that it is, in fact, too late.\nIt\u2019s true that a retroactive ruling is unprecedented in recent years. However, violation forms can be filed up to 24 hours after said violation occurs.\nDespite the violation form being submitted an hour and a half past the end of the voting period, a form submitted in this time frame should be considered. Students can only be expected to submit forms so quickly. If a campaign is doing something in violation of the guidelines right up until voting ends, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for a sanction form to come in past the voting deadline, and be considered by the election board.\nIf the election board does its due diligence and considers the violation form, there is little question about what should be done. It\u2019s too late to ban the Social Justice Referendum from campaigning online. And having a band on Bruin Walk singing to call for people to vote for the referendum when there is supposed to be no campaigning at all is an egregious violation of the previous sanction. This comes after a week in which the Social Justice Referendum representatives have been found guilty of spending nearly 10 times the amount originally allowed, and continuing to campaign while under sanction.\nIn the interview with The Bruin on Thursday, Allen admitted that the election season this year was not fair.\nTherefore, the only option left for the election board is to disqualify the Social Justice Referendum of 2016.\nMore than $2 million of student fees are on the line, and not even considering the submitted sanction form is grossly irresponsible.\nThere is no doubt that a disqualification this late in the process will be unpopular with some. But being popular isn\u2019t the goal of the election board; it is to oversee a fair election. Considering the violation form and disqualifying the Social Justice Referendum is the duty of the election board, and it should have no fear in doing what it is supposed to.\n ",

        "content": "\nLast Friday\u2019s Undergraduate Students Association Council candidates debate was meant to be an important platform for uninformed voters to learn about the election. Instead, it turned out be a mutual-admiration society between overexcited supporters and their deities. \nAlthough that might seem very similar to the crowds at U.S. presidential debates, the USAC candidate debates were supposed to be the first major outreach program during the campaign cycle for candidates to explain their platforms. The crowd, however, consisted of about 100 non-slate-affiliated viewers who watched the proceedings passively. Those viewers trickled out of the auditorium as the debate went on, with only a few left to watch the presidential candidates\u2019 debate. \nOther outreach programs such as \u201cMeet the Candidates\u201d and the endorsement hearing reach even smaller numbers of undecided voters. As a result, a large segment of the student body is left in the dark on campaign details, save for the candidates\u2019 verbose Facebook posts on their platforms. \n The serious and more far-reaching part of the calendar is physical campaigning, which began Monday. However, voting for the election began at 10 a.m. that day, just two hours after the start of physical campaigning. This affords students the chance to vote before they can even look at campaigning on Bruin Walk and Election Walk on the way to class. Naturally, these students might vote for the candidates endorsed by their student organization leaders if that\u2019s the only voice they\u2019ve heard. In effect, a calendar consisting of physical campaigning several days after the endorsement hearings encourages an oligarchy of student body leaders, long before students themselves hear from the actual candidates\u2019 campaigns.\nThe student government currently controls more than $4 million in student fees and deserves an equivalent amount of attention. The current short campaign calendar prevents physical campaigners from reaching a larger portion of the student body. In addition, it sends out the message that the USAC election is only important enough to be mentioned on campus during the five voting days. The system also allows students to make uninformed voting decisions before they can even view the campaigning. To prevent this, the election board should bring forward the start of  physical campaigning into the week before the election. \nStarting physical campaigning earlier would help campaigns reach out to voters well ahead of the election. This would give students time to consider all the voting options before the polls open. The election board itself had expressed a similar sentiment in 2014, when then-chair Anthony Padilla ensured voting started a day after fliering started so students could reflect on the elections for one day. This short extension didn\u2019t help increase turnout, but bringing physical campaigning forward in a similar way can definitely make voters more informed before they have the opportunity to vote.\nThis can also create a less chaotic atmosphere of campaigning on the days of voting, resulting in a relative period of campaign silence on those days. This would be slightly akin to the electoral silence present in countries such as Canada and New Zealand, where campaigning is banned on voting days to cool off tensions and balance campaigning.\nEven history suggests that earlier physical campaigning improves voter turnout. 2011 was the last time leafletting started the week before voting, on the Thursday before the election. The turnout for the election was 38.1 percent  \u2013 the second highest turnout in the past nine years and 8.5 percentage points higher than 2015\u2019s turnout.\nThis move could also benefit candidates running on independent platforms. These candidates usually lack the support that Bruins United and its rival slate get from student organizations in terms of endorsements. An extended fliering period would reduce the importance of endorsements relative to campaigning, neutralizing the advantage received by the two main slates. \nElection Board Chair Lindsay Allen said that the board doesn\u2019t lengthen the campaign season by multiple weeks to avoid fatiguing voters. Asking for such a long extension would certainly be unreasonable,  but even then, voter fatigue is considered to be a result of voters feeling they have too many elections to vote in. Longer campaigns aren\u2019t generally a reason for voter fatigue, especially when voters have the convenience of voting online. The main issue here is that about seven out of 10 undergraduate students don\u2019t vote. Even some who do are not fully informed of the importance of USAC and the election. \nIt is unlikely that the 29.6 percent of the student body that votes is going to be turned off from the election due to earlier or longer campaigning. Even if it were likely, the risk would be well worth it if that meant the other 70.4 percent of students became more aware of the importance of the election. The current campaign cycle, with campaigners popping up only during election week, only reinforces the belief that the USAC election is unimportant.\nAs radical as having a few extra days of annoying campaigners sounds, initiating a change in the campaign calendar would be a relatively simple process. Allen said that a small change in the campaign calendar, such as a week\u2019s change, would be arbitrary. Taking into consideration an increase in voter turnout and better dissemination of electoral knowledge among potential voters, next year\u2019s election board should attempt to bring forward the start of physical campaigning.  Every campaign calendar put forward by the board needs the student government\u2019s approval, and it is unlikely that the council members would turn down an opportunity to have their supporters sing their praises throughout campus for a few extra days.\nFor the benefit of the student body, the election board should extend a measure that can give USAC and the election as\nmuch visibility on Bruin Walk as those $1 doughnuts.\n ",
